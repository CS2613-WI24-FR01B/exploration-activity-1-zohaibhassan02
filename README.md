# Seaborn Sample Program ReadMe

## 1. Which package/library does the sample program demonstrate?

The sample program demonstrates the usage of the [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) package in Python for data visualization and analysis.

## 2. How does someone run your program?

To run the program, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
3. Install the required libraries by running `pip install seaborn pandas matplotlib.pyplot`.
4. Place your dataset (e.g., `housing.csv`) in the same directory as the Python script.
5. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
6. Run the Python script in visual studio code (use kernel version python 3.11.7) using the run button.

## 3. What purpose does your program serve?

The program serves the purpose of analyzing and visualizing a housing dataset using Seaborn. It provides insights into the relationships between different features (e.g., number of rooms, percentage of lower status population, pupil-teacher ratio) and the median house value. The visualizations generated by the program help users understand the factors that influence housing prices.
